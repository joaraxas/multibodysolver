MBS (Multibody solver)

Python package for solution of constrained rigid body dynamics problems.
See the manual, code documentation, and examples for details.

This package was developed as a exploratory tool in preparation for full implementation in Discrete element software Demify https://demify.se/
In particular, the objective was a simple tool that could be coupled to particle dynamics simulation via a coding interface. 
It is generally applicable on its own, however. I'm publishing it for education purposes. Feel free to use it in your project or to study the implementation.
